    <p>When I was younger I discovered the Pokemon anime. I loved it from the very beginning. I was also very interested in my mothers black Nintendo DS. After becoming obsessed with Pokemon and the Nintendo DS my parents made a wonderful connection. They bought me a Pokemon game that ran on the DS. That is where my love of video games started. Like the genius child I was I refused to read the instruction manual. I didn't even know how to interact. After a good amount of button mashing I was able to get a decent hold on the buttons. The first game I played was Pokemon Black and the starter I chose was Tepig. </p>

    <p>Since this was my first game my strategy was impecable. I only trained my starting Pokemon. I found this strategy to work well until the elite four battle. I struggled to beat them with my singular pokemon with only one type of move. The psychic elite four member was the most difficult. Emboar which is Tepigs evolved form is part fighting type. Psychic is super effective agianst fighting so I was at an extreme disadvantage. I kept trying until I leved up and had a run with very good luck. I was then allowed to catch the legendary pokemon called reshiram.</p>

    <p>Once I caught Reshiram and the rest of the game was easy. I became champion. After a little bit of research I figured out that I didn't have the greates strategy. When Pokemon Black 2 came out I wanted it as soon as possible. Through that playthrough I did a bit better with my strategy but it was still very bad. I replayed both games many times to try and improve my playing. Then Pokemon X and Y came out. By this time I had my own 3Ds and my love for video games had expanded. At this time I had a good understanding of the mechanics of Pokemon. The rest of the games that came out were easier than Black. Now I have 6 perfect IV snoms. I don't think you'll know what this means but it's pretty funny. I also enjoy shiny hunting. That's when you hunt for a pokemon for hours just so it changes color a little bit. Pokemon was what first got me into video games. I will continue to play the new games even if they do suck. Probably.</p>
