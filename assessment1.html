    <h1>Okay</h1>

    <h3>Stories...? I guess...?</h3>

      <p style="color:#b81515">"As soon as I’m in the trees, I retrieve a bow and <strong>sheath</strong> of arrows from a hollow log. Electrified or not, the fence has been successful at keeping the flesh-eaters out of District 12. <strong>Inside</strong> the woods they roam freely, and there are added concerns like venomous snakes, rabid animals, and no real paths to follow. But there’s also food if you know how to find it. My father knew and he taught me some before he was blown to bits in a mine explosion. There was <strong>nothing</strong> even to bury. I was eleven then. Five years later, I still wake up screaming for him to run" (Suzanne Collins)</p>

      <p style="background-color:#003366"> "There sleeps Titania sometime of the night, Lulled in these flowers with dances and delight. And there the snake throws her enameled skin, Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in. And with the juice of this I’ll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies. (<em>gives ROBIN some of the flower</em>) Take thou some of it and seek through this grove: A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth. Anoint his eyes. But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady. Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on. Effect it with some care, that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love. And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow." (William Shakespeare)</p>

    <h3>What?</h3>

      <p style="text-align:center"><a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple Computer</a> "But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." (Abraham Lincoln)</p>
