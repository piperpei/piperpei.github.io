    <h1>Animal Crossing was pretty much my childhood</h1>

    <h3>It helped me connect with other kids at my school. It was one of the first and really the only game that I would play online with my friends.</h3>

    <p>Animal Crossing is a simple game where you build up a town with cute little animal villagers. I started to play it because one of my friends did. I fell in love with it. Even though it seems a bit boring the little tasks of day to day life were entertaining. Catching rare fish and making bells to pay off your loan was interesting. You can build your town as you want it and there are so many things to do. Animal Crossing is one of those games that you can't really complete. There is no end. There really is no story. The game is over when you want it to be over. You can get bored with it but it is always ready to pick up and play. My friend and I loved to play it together. Not many of my friends played video games. If they did they didn't play the ones that I liked. It was nice to have that connection away from school. I was a bit of an idiot and somehow messed up in a game where you couldn't mess up but I had a fun time with my friend. Now with the new game out I can still play with some of my friends and relax with a beutiful game.</p>
