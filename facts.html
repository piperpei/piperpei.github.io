Introduced in 1934, it was originally called Chicken with Noodles and enjoyed only moderate success. Later that same year an innocent misstatement on the Amos 'n' Andy radio program caused sales to sky-rocket. Amos misread his copy and accidentally called the product Chicken Noodle soup. Suddenly the soup company started receiving large orders for their new product. The soup was formally renamed Chicken Noodle after the erroneous turn of phrase caused high demand for the soup.

  <p>- Roundworms, given the chance, will happily infest your guts where they can survive for a long time. They'll take up residence in your intestines, living, feeding and reproducing there. If they go undetected, they can spread in large numbers throughout other parts of your body, too.</p>
  
  <p>- Fully grown roundworms can be up to a foot long. The first most people know about having them is when they go to the bathroom and find that their poop is wriggling with living things.</p>
  
  <p>- Tapeworms can grow up to 30 feet long.</p>
  
  <p>- Parasites are the most common form of life on Earth. Scientists believe that over 80% of all living things are parasites.</p>
  
  <p>- Modern parasitologists recognize that they have not found all human parasites. They estimate that hundreds if not thousands of human parasites will be found in the coming years.</p>
  
  <p>- John Matthews of Iowa went to the doctor when his vision became spotty and hazy. He had a parasitic worm in his eye eating away at his retina. Doctors were able to kill the worm with a laser, but not before the parasite did permanent damage to his retina and optic nerve.</p>
  
  <p>- In the United States, at least 70 people, most of them children, are blinded by the parasite (a roundworm) that causes toxocariasis, which is transmitted to humans through infected dog and cat feces.</p>
  
  <p>- Parasites are separated into three groups: 1) protozoa, which are tiny, one-celled organisms; 2) helminths, or worm parasites, such as tapeworms and pinworms; and 3) arthropods, which aren’t parasites themselves, but these insects and spiders are common hosts of parasitic diseases.</p>
  
  <p>- There are two kinds of human parasites: endoparasites, which cause infection inside the body, and ectoparasites, which cause infection outside the body on the skin.</p>
  
  <p>- Humans are hosts to over 300 species of parasitic worms and over 70 species of protozoa.</p>
  
  <p>- There are over 30,000 species of mites and they live almost everywhere. The earliest mite fossil dates to about 400 million years ago.</p>
  
  <p>- The earliest known human parasite is a lung fluke, and it was found in fossilized feces in northern Chile dating from 5900 B.C. Additionally, ancient Egyptian mummies from as early 2000 B.C. contain tapeworm eggs.</p>
  
  <p>- Loa loa, or “eye worm,” is a parasitic worm that lives in human and other mammal eyes. Creepily, a human can feel it moving around in his or her eye and may even seen the worm if its big enough. It can live inside a human for 17 years.</p>
  
  <p>- A human botfly is a spine-covered larva that burrows into living humans and feeds on their flesh. While its nesting site may look like a mosquito bite, poking from a hardened lump on the skin are two little breathing tubes, which allow the larvae to breathe and remain under the skin while it feeds.</p>
  
  <p>- Tapeworms do not have eyes. Rather the indentions on each side of their heads are suction cups used to attach it to a victim’s intestines.</p>
  
  <p>- Hookworms are the only worms known to have teeth. Its Latin name, Necator americanus, means “American murderer.” It can spend 15 years or more in the intestine, feeding and reproducing.</p>
  
  <p>- While most animals with jaws have two jaws that form the framework of the mouth, leeches have three jaws holding razor-sharp teeth arranged to make a Y-shaped bite.</p>
  
  <p>- The Naegleria fowleri ameba, or the “brain-eating amoeba,” makes its home in people’s brains. Infection causes brain inflammation, extensive destruction of brain tissue, vomiting, stiff neck, hallucinations, and seizures. After the onset of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and causes death within 3–7 days.</p>
  
  <p>- Fungi feed on plant and animal matter, both living and dead. In humans, fungi can cause annoying infections, such as athlete’s foot, jock itch, and ringworm. Ringworm looks like a parasitic worm curled up under the skin’s surface, but it’s really a fungus.</p>
  
  <p>- Tribes in Turkestan used to torture prisoners to death with ticks. They would chain a prisoner to a board in a cell and release swarms of ticks that were raised and kept hungry for that purpose. Slowly, they would drain the prisoner of his blood.</p>
  
  <p>- Though some fish can breathe on land taking oxygen from air, most of the fish, when taken out of water, suffocate and die. This is because gill arches of fish collapse, when taken out of water, leaving the blood vessels no longer exposed to oxygen in air.</p>
  
  <p>- Stock entry doors come in several standard sizes: Height: 80 inches (6 feet, 8 inches) Thickness: 1 ¾ inches. Width: 36 inches standard; 30 and 32 inch widths also in stock.</p>
  
  <p>- Tennessee and Missouri each share borders with eight states. Here are the states with their neighbors, listed clockwise. Tennessee: Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Missouri. Missouri: Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska.</p>
  
  <p>...etc. but I'm too lazy to find any more.</p>
