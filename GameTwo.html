    <p>As I grew more confident in my gaming skills I wanted to reach out and try new games. One of the games that I kept noticing was called Fire Emblem. It was somewhat similar to Pokemon and it semmed like I would be good at it. It tempeted me for many years and yet I refused to get it. The reason was because it scared me. One of the core features of the game is perma-death. This means that if your character dies they die forever. I don't know why but this made me very nervous as a kid. I didn't like to think that my units would die and never come back. I didn't get the game for a long time. Finally my curiosity grew over the fear and i got the game. It turned out to be one of my most favorite games of all time. I started out by playing the game called Fire Emblem Awakening.</p>

    <p>Lucky for me the game was later in the series. This meant that there were multiple settings. You could turn perma-death off. Hooray. I found that I was really bad at the game. Like Pokemon I just trained up the base units. I've come back to play this game many more times even with perma-death on. I have gotten much better strategy wise. the turn based grid combat system was a bit strange for me to learn but I loved it. I continue to play Fire Emblem today and plan to continue. Their games seem to be getting better and better (unlike Pokemon) so I look forward to their next release. </p>
